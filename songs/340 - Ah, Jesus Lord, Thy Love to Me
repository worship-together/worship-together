verse      Ah,   Je  - sus    Lord,  Thy   love to    me     No   thought can    reach, no
verse      O,    grant that   noth - ing   in   my    soul   May  dwell   but    Thy    pure
verse      O     Lord, how    gra -  cious is   thy   way!   All  fear    be  -  fore   Thy
verse      This  love  un  -  wear - ied   I    pur - sue    And  daunt - less - ly     to
verse      O,    draw  me,    Sav -  ior,  e'er to    Thee;  So   shall   I      run    and
verse      More  hard  than   mar -  ble   is   my    heart, And  foul    with   sins   of
verse      Still let   Thy    love   point out  my    way;   What won  -  drous  things Thy
verse      In    suf - f'ring be     Thy   love my    peace, In   weak -  ness   be     Thy

verse      tongue de - clare;    O     bind  my     thank - ful   heart to    Thee   And
verse      love   a -  lone!     O,    may   Thy    love    pos - sess  me    whole, My
verse      pres - ence flies;    Care, an -  guish, sor  -  row,  melt  a  -  way    Wher -
verse      Thee   as - pire.     O,    may   Thy    love    my    hope  re -  new,   Burn
verse      nev -  er   tire.     With  gra - cious  words   still com - fort  me;    Be
verse      deep - est  stain;    But   Thou  the    might - y     Sav - ior   art,   Nor
verse      love   hath wrought!  Still lead  me     lest    I     go    a  -  stray; Di -
verse      love   my   pow'r;    And   when  the    storms  of    live  shall cease, O

verse      reign  with - our      a    ri    -  val  there.   Thine, whol - ly   Thine, a -
verse      joy,   my     treas -  ure, and      my   crown!   All    cold - ness from   my
verse      e'er   thy    heal  -  ing  hands    a -  rise.    O      Je  -  sus, noth - ing
verse      in     my     soul     like heav'n - ly   fire!    And    day    and  night  be
verse      Thou   my     Hope,    my   sole     De - sire.    Free   me     from ev  -  ery
verse      flowed Thy    cleans - ing  blood    in   vain;    Ah     soft - en,  melt   this
verse      rect   my     work,    in - spire    my   thought; And    if     I    fall,  soon
verse      Je  -  sus,   in       that fi   -   nal  khour    Be     Thou   my   Rod    and

verse      lone, I'd  live; My  -  self  to   Thee   en -  tire  -  ly  give.
verse      heart re - move; My     ev -  ery  act,   word, thought, be  love.
verse      may   I    see,  Noth - ing   de - sire   or    seek,    but Thee!
verse      all   my   care  To     guard this sa  -  cred  treas -  ure there.
verse      guilt and  fear; No     sin   can  harm   if    Thou     art near.
verse      rock, and  may   Thy    blood wash all    these stains   a - way!
verse      may   I    hear  Thy    voice and  know   that  love     is  near!
verse      Staff and  Guide And    draw  me   safe - ly    to       Thy side.
