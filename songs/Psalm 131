verse      Lord, my heart is not haught - y, nor mine eyes loft - y:

verse      Nei - ther do I ex - er - cise my - self in great mat - ters, or in things too high for me.

verse      Sure - ly I have be - haved and qui - et - ed my - self, as a child that is weaned of his moth - er:

verse      my soul is e - ven as a weaned child.

verse      Let Is - rael hope in the Lord from hence - forth and for ev - er.
