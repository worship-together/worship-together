verse      Let all  the   stars in   the skies  give praise,
verse      Let Ra - chel  weep  for  her chil - dren lost
verse      Let Ja - cob's star  rise in  east - ern  skies,

verse      Let all  the heav - ens their an - thems raise,
verse      And Ra - mah cry    at  the   aw - ful   cost.
verse      And let  a   scep - ter from  Is - rael  rise,

verse      Come down and sing  them in   the shep - herd's night,
verse      Jo - seph is  warned_    in   a   dream  to     run,
verse      Come down and guide the  wise men to     the    place

verse      Glo - ry  to  God   for  in - car -  nate  Light.
verse      And   out of  E  -  gypt is   called the   Son.
verse      Where God has vis - i -  ted  A   -  dam's race.
