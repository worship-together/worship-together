verse      Bless   now   the  man    who does  not  walk
verse      His     full  de - light  is  in    the  law,
verse      Plant - ed    deep by     the riv - er - side,
verse      Not     so    the  wick - ed, who   will die.
verse      God     knows the  way    of  all   His  host,

verse      In   the    ways   of    un -  god - ly    men,
verse      On   ho  -  ly     laws  he    med - i  -  tates.
verse      This tree   brings forth the   sea - son's fruit.
verse      They are    like   chaff which blows a  -  way
verse      The  wick - ed     die   a     god - less  death.

verse      Who    does  not    stand  in    paths  of    sin
verse      All    day   and    night  he    con  - tem - plates
verse      His    leaf  is     nour - ished from   the   root;
verse      And    can - not    stand  on    judg - ment  day,
verse      Praise Him,  praise Him,   those who    have  breath,

verse      And    will  not   sit   where mock - ers   talk.
verse      And    holds the   truth in    rev -  erent awe.
verse      Pros - per - i  -  ty    is    full   and   wide.
verse      When   He    will  lift  the   saints on    high.
verse      Praise Fa -  ther, Son,  and   Ho  -  ly    Ghost.
