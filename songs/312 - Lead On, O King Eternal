verse      Lead on, O King e - ter - nal, The  day   of     march has   come;
verse      Lead on, O King e - ter - nal, Till sin's fierce war   shall cease,
verse      Lead on, O King e - ter - nal: We   fol - low,   not   with  fears,

verse      Hence - forth  in   fields of    con  - quest Thy    tents shall be   our  home:
verse      And     ho   - li - ness   shall whis - per   The    sweet A -   men  of   peace;
verse      For     glad - ness breaks like  morn - ing   Wher - e're  Thy   face ap - pears

verse      Through days  of   prep - a -  ra.   - tion Thy grace  has made   us   strong,
verse      For     not   with swords loud clash - ing, Nor roll   of  stir - ring drums,
verse      Thy     cross is   lift - ed   o're    us;  We  jour - ney in     its  light;

verse      And now,  O   King  e - ter - nal,   We   lift     our bat  - tle song.
verse      But deeds of  love  and mer - cy,    The  heav'n - ly  king - dom comes.
verse      The crown a - waits the con - quest; Lead on,      O   God    of  might.
