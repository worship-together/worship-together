verse      Though the fig tree may not blos - som, Nor fruit be on the vines;

verse      Though the la - bor of the o - live may fail, And the fields yield no food;

verse      Though the flock may be cut off from the fold, And there be no herd in the stalls

verse      Yet I will re - joice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my sal - va - tion.

verse      The Lord God is my strength; He will make my feet like deer's feet,

verse      And He will make me walk on my high hills.
