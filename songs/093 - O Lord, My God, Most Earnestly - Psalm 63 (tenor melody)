verse      O    LORD,  my    God,   most ear - nest - ly   I  seek your ho - ly  face,
verse      The   lov - ing - kind - ness of     my    God  is more than life to  me,
verse      Be - neath  the   sha  - dow  of    your  wings I  sing  my  joy  and praise.

verse      With - in  your house   a - gain  to    see    the   glo - ries   of   your  grace.
verse      So     I   will praise you   all  my    days   and   pray   con - tin - ual - ly.
verse      Your right hand   is   my  strong sup - port through trou - bled nights and  days.

verse      A -  part from you  I  long and  thirst, and naught  can   sat - is - fy;
verse      In   you   my  soul is sat - is - fied,  my   dark - ness turns  to   light,
verse      All those who  seek my life will  fall;  my   life    is   in   your  hand.

verse      I     wan - der in     a   des - ert  land  where all    the streams are  dry.
verse      And   joy - ful med -  i - ta - tions fill   the watch - es    of    the  night.
verse      God's king  and peo - ple will   re - joice; in   vic - t'ry  they   will stand.
