verse      It's   good    to    thank the  LORD,  To     praise Your  name,  Most
verse      Your   deeds,  LORD, make  me   glad.  I'll   joy    in    what   You've
verse      Though sin  -  ners  grow  like weeds, Ill -  do  -  ers   blos - som
verse      You've raised, like  ox,   my   horn,  Poured fresh  oil   on     my
verse      Those  plant - ed    by    the  LORD   Shall  in     God's courts be

verse      High!  To      show   Your    love  at    dawn,     Your faith - ful -
verse      done.  How     great  Your    do -  ings, LORD!     How  deep    Your
verse      may,   They're doomed to      be    de -  stroyed.  You, LORD,   ex -
verse      head.  You     made   me      see   the   spies     And  hear    what
verse      seen;  When    old    they'll still bear  fruit     And  flour - ish

verse      ness     all  night!  The   ten  -  stringed lyre   With
verse      thoughts each one!    Fools won't   be       shown; The
verse      alt  -   ed   stay.   LORD, Your    foes     fall.  See!
verse      plot  -  ters said.   Like  thriv - ing      palm   The

verse      stu  -  pid    can't  ac - cept  this  truth, To   him    un -  known!
verse      How     Your   foes,  vain e  -  vil   men,   Are  scat - tered all!
verse      right - eous   grows, like ce -  dars  tall   On   Leb -  a  -  non.
