verse      If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, Let Is - ra - el now say--

verse      If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, When men rose up a - gainst us,

verse      Then they would have swal - lowed us a - live, When their wrath was kin - dled a - gainst us;

verse      Then the wa - ters would have o - ver - whelmed us,

verse      The stream would have gone o - ver our soul;

verse      Then the swol - len wa - ters would have gone o - ver our soul.

verse      Bless - ed be the Lord, who has not giv - en us as prey to their teeth.

verse      Our soul has es - caped as a bird from the snare of the fowl - ers;

verse      The snare is bro - ken, and we have es - caped.

verse      Our help is in the name of the Lord, Who made heav - - - en and earth.
