verse      Vin - di - cate me, O God, And plead my cause a - gainst an un - god - ly nation;

verse      Oh, de - liv - er me from the de - ceit - ful and un - just man!

verse      For You are the God of my strength; Why do You cast me off?

verse      Why do I go mourn - ing be - cause of the op - pres - sion of the en - e - my?

verse      Oh, send out Your light and Your truth!  Let them lead me;

verse      Let them bring me to Your ho - ly hill And to Your tab - er - na - cle.

verse      Then I will go to the al - tar of God, To God my ex - ceed - ing joy;

verse      And on the harp I will praise You, O God, my God.

verse      Why are you cast down, O my soul?  And why are you dis - qui - et - ed with - in me?

verse      Hope in God; For I shall yet praise Him, The help of my countenance and my God.
