verse      My     Sav - ior  God    is     all    my    light, Whom   shall I     fear  be - side   Him?
verse      Though ar -  mies camp   a   -  round  me    here   My     heart shall nev - er   trem - ble.
verse      In     times of   trou - ble    I      will  seek   To     hide  in    His   pa - vil -  ion.
verse      O      LORD  my   God,   please hear   with  grace, Please hear  my    fer - vent cry -  ing.
verse      My     fa -  ther and    my     moth - er    flee,  Yet    still the   LORD  will save   me.

verse      My     God  is  strength, and  life   and  sight, I   can -  not   fear  be - side   Him.
verse      Though wars a - rise,     I    will   not  fear,  His grac - es    I     as - sem -  ble.
verse      He     sets me  on        a    moun - tain peak,  My  God    pro - tects His  chil - dren.
verse      Your   Word has said      to   seek   Your face,  You save   my    soul  from dy  -  ing.
verse      Teach  me,  O   God,      that I      may  see    The path   of    life  You  gave   me.

verse      And  when  my   foes   Would eat    my   flesh, In   pride those foes have stum - bled.
verse      I    seek  one  thing, The   house  of   God,   That I     may   see  His  beau - ty.

verse      Turn not   Your face   A  -  way    from me,    Nor  turn  a  -  way  in   an  -  ger.

verse      Their ha - tred grows, Their traps  are   mesh, But  head - long they have tum -  bled.
verse      And   I    will sing   My    praise to    God,  With ho  -  li - ness my   du  -  ty.
verse      With  joy  my   bread, With  praise my    cup,  My   wor -  ship I    will of  -  fer.
