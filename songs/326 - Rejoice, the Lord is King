verse      Re - joice, the Lord  is    King:   Your Lord  and  King   a  -  dore!   Re -
verse      Je - sus,   the Sav - ior,  reigns, The  God   of   truth  and   love;   When
verse      His  king - dom can - not   fail,   He   rules o'er earth  and   heav'n; The
verse      He   sits   at  God's right hand    Till all   His  foes   sub - mit,    And
verse      Re - joice  in  glo - rious hope!   Our  Lord, the  Judge, shall come,   And

verse      joice, give thanks and   sing,   And tri - umph ev -  er - more.
verse      He     had  purged our   stains, He  took  His  seat  a -  bove.
verse      keys   of   death  and   hell    Are to    our  Je -  sus  giv'n.
verse      bow    to   His    com - mand,   And fall  be - neath His  feet.
verse      take   His  ser -  vants up      To  their e -  ter - nal  home.

verse      Lift up your heart,

verse      Lift up your voice!  Re - joice, a - gain I say, re - joice!
