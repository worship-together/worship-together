verse      Strick - en, smit - ten, and   af - flict -  ed,  See  Him    dy - ing on   the  tree!
verse      Tell     me,  ye    who  hear Him   groan - ing,  Was there   ev - er grief like His?
verse      Ye      who think   of   sin  but   light -  ly   Nor  sup - pose  the  e - vil  great
verse      Here     we  have    a   firm foun - da  -  tion, Here the   ref - uge of   the  lost;

verse      'Tis      the   Christ by   man   re - ject - ed;  Yes, my   soul, 'tis He, 'tis    He!
verse      Friends through fear   His cause dis - own - ing,  Foes in - sult - ing His  dis - tress;
verse      Here      may   view   its  na - ture right - ly,  Here its guilt   may es - ti -  mate.
verse      Christ's  the   Rock   of   our  sal -  va - tion, His  the  name   of which we    boast.

verse      'Tis the long - ex - pect - ed   Proph - et, Da - vid's Son, yet    Da - vid's Lord;
verse      Man - y hands  were raised  to   wound  Him, None would in - ter - pose   to   save;
verse      Mark the sac -  ri - fice   ap - point - ed, See   who bears the    aw  - ful  load;
verse      Lamb of  God,  for   sin - ners  wound - ed, Sac - ri - fice to     can - cel  guilt!

verse      By    His Son    God  now   has    spo - ken: 'Tis the  true  and  faith - ful Word.
verse      But   the deep - est stroke that pierced Him  Was  the stroke that  Jus - tice gave.
verse      'Tis  the Word,  the Lord's  A -  noint - ed, Son  of   Man   and   Son    of  God.
verse      None shall ev  - er    be   con - found - ed  Who  on   Him  their hope   have built.
