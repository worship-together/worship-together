verse      Blest is    the  man    whose tres - pass is     for - giv  -  en,
verse      When  I     kept si  -  lent, sin -  ful  ways   con - don  -  ing,
verse      Let   all   the  god -  ly    when   they grieve and   suf  -  fer
verse      I     will  in - struct you,  with   my   aid    pro - vide    you,
verse      With  man - y    woes   the   wick - ed   area   af -  flict - ed,

verse      Whose sins  are cov -  ered    in    the    sight of    heav -  en.
verse      I     pined a - way    through my    in  -  ces - sant  groan - ing.
verse      To    Thee, O   LORD,  their   sup - pli -  ca -  tions of   -  fer.
verse      And   in    the way    that    you   should go    will  guide   you.
verse      But   he    who trusts in      God   is     well  pro - tect -  ed;

verse      Blest  is     the     man    a -  gainst  whom, LORD, Thou  wilt
verse      Thy    hand   weighed down   on   me      in    my    de -  ceit;
verse      Sure - ly     when    floods of   might - y     wa -  ters  rise,
verse      My     coun - sel     will   be   ev   -  er    at    your  side,
verse      Him    will   the     LORD   with stead - fast  love  sur - round.

verse      Not   count    all  his    in - iq - ui - ty    and   guilt.
verse      My    strength was  sapped as   by   the  sum - mer's heat.
verse      They  shall    not  reach  him  who  on   Thee  re -  lies.
verse      And,  keep  -  ing  watch, I    will with you   a  -  bide.
verse      Those who      re - vere   Him  are  with mer - cy    crowned.

verse      How  hap - py he,     con - trite of   heart and   low  -  ly,
verse      To   Thee, O  God     of    jus - tice and   com - pas  -  sion,
verse      Thou art   a  hid  -  ing   place for  those who   serve   Thee;
verse      Be   not   a  fool,   who   has   no   un -  der - stand - ing;
verse      Be   glad, O  right - eous, in    the  LORD  re -  joic -  ing;

verse      Who   has     con - fessed his  sins,   O     LORD  most    ho  -  ly;
verse      I     then    at    last   ac - knowl - edged my    trans - gres - sion.
verse      Thou, might - y     God,   from trou -  ble   dost  pre  -  serve  me.
verse      Do    not     be -  have   like horse   or    mule, de  -   pend - ing
verse      Ex -  ult     in    Him,   your ju  -   bi -  la -  tion    voic - ing,

verse      Who   does  not  se -  cret - ly   Thy   laws  trans - gress,
verse      I     said, I    will  con -  fess my    sins  to      Thee,
verse      Songs of    de - liv - 'rance ev - 'ry - where re   -  sound:
verse      On    bit   and  bri - dle    to   con - trol  their   course;
verse      For   light and  life  He     will to    you   im   -  part.

verse      Whose spir - it   har - bors no     de -  ceit  -  ful - ness.
verse      And   all    my   guilt Thou hast   for - giv   -  en    me.
verse      Thou  me     with great re - joic - ing   dost     sur - round.
verse      They  dis -  o -  bey   un - less   re -  strained by    force.
verse      Now   shout  for  joy,  you  men    of    up   -   right heart.
