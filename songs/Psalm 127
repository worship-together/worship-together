verse      Ex - cept the Lord build the house, they la - bor in vain that build it:

verse      Ex - cept the Lord keep the ci - ty, the watch - man wak - eth but in vain.

verse      It is vain for you to rise up ear - ly, to sit up late,

verse      to eat the bread of sor - rows: for so he giv - eth his be - lov - ed sleep.

verse      Lo, chil - dren are an her - i - tage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his re - ward.

verse      As ar - rows are in the hand of a might - y man; so are chil - dren of the youth.

verse      Hap - py is the man that hath his qui - ver full of them:

verse      They shall not be a - shamed, but they shall speak with the en - e - mies in the gate.
