verse      Be not      far off,  for grief is     near,  And none  to  help   is   found;
verse      My strength is  on -  ly  bro - ken    clay;  My  mouth and tongue are  dry,
verse      My bones    are plain for me    to     count; men see   me  and    they stare.

verse      For bulls   of  Ba -  shan in   their strength Now cir - cle  me  a  -  round.
verse      For in      the ver - y    dust of    death    You there make me  to    lie.
verse      My  clothes a - mong  them they di -  vide,    And gam - ble  for their share.

verse      Their li -  on - jaws they o    -    pen wide,  And roar  to tear their prey.
verse      For   see   how  dogs en - cir   -   cle me!    On  eve - ry side there stands
verse      Now   hur - ry,  O    my   Strength, to  help!  Do  not   be far, O     LORD!

verse      My  heart   is   wax, my   bones un - knit, My   life   is poured a - way.
verse      A   broth - er - hood of   cru - el - ty;   They pierce my feet   and hands.
verse      But snatch  my   soul from rag - ing  dogs, And  spare  me from   the sword.
