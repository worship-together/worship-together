verse      O       Lord, our   king  re - joic -  es   Be -  cause  Your  strength is    great,
verse      He      asked for   life, You  gave    it,  He    prayed for   length   of    days,
verse      Our     king  in    God   has  trust - ed,  Your  mer -  cy    holds    him   fast.
verse      Their   fruit shall all   be   ta  -   ken, You   shall  de  - stroy    their seed.

verse      And in    sal - va   -  tion, voic - es   Shall Your  great strength re - late.
verse      His glo - ry    stands, You   save   it   In    maj - es -  ty       and  praise.
verse      His en -  e  -  mies    have  lust - ed   For   blood their hour     is   past.
verse      The harm  they  sought  is    sha -  ken, Your  wrath is    wrath    in - deed.

verse      In   good -  ness he   is    plant - ed,   What he    de -  sired
verse      You  blessed Your king for - ev  -   er    And  shall for - sake
verse      You  take    them with great burn  - ing,  Your wrath is    here
verse      They turn    to   flee Your  ar  -   rows, And  face  e  -  ter -

verse      You  grant - ed;   You gave   a    crown     of   gold.
verse      him  nev  -  er,   His glad - ness now       as - cends.
verse      re - turn -  ing   And You    de - stroy     them all.
verse      nal  sor  -  rows, We  sing   Your strength, O    God.
