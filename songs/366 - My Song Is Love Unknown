verse      Why,   what  hath my     Lord  done?   What  makes this  rage    and

verse      me,     Love  to      the   love  -  less shown, That  they     might love  -  ly
verse      stow;   But   men     made  strange, and  none   The   longed - for   Christ   would
verse      sing;   Re -  sound - ing   all      the  day    Ho -  san   -  nas   to       their
verse      spite?  He    made    the   lame     to   run,   He    gave     the   blind    their
verse      way;    A     mur  -  der - er       they save,  The   Prince   of    Life     they

verse      know.   But   oh,     my    Friend, my     Friend in  -  deed,
verse      King.   Then  Cru  -  ci -  fy!     is     all    their  breath,
verse      sight.  Sweet in  -   jur - ies!    Yet    they   at     these
verse      slay.   Yet   cheer - ful   He      to     suf -  f'ring goes,
verse      gave.   What  may     I     say?    Heav'n was    His    home,
verse      thine.  This  is      my    Friend, in     whose  sweet  praise

verse      My     Lord   should take    frail   flesh   and   die?
verse      Who    at     my     need    His     life    did   spend!
verse      And    for    His    death   they    thirst  and   cry.
verse      Them - selves dis -  please, And     'gainst Him   rise.
verse      That   He     His    foes    from    thence  might free.
verse      But    mine   the    tomb    where - in      He    lay.
verse      I      all    my     days    could   glad -  ly    spend.
