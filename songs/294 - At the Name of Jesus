verse      God     from ev  -  er  -  last - ing,   Ve - ry   light of   light:
verse      All     the  an  -  gel    fac -  es,    All  the  hosts of   light,
verse      From    the  lips   of     sin -  ners   Un - to   whom  He   came,
verse      Through all  ranks  of     crea - tures, To   the  cen - tral height,
verse      But     with awe    and    won -  der    And  with bat - ed   breath!
verse      All     that is     not    ho  -  ly,    All  that is    not  true;
verse      With    His  Fa  -  ther's glo -  ry,    With His  an -  gel  train;

verse      'Tis    the   Fa   -  ther's plea - sure   We     should call   Him    Lord,
verse      In      the   Fa   -  ther's bos -  om     With   the    Spir - it     blest,
verse      Thrones and   dom  -  i   -  na  -  tions, Stars  up  -  on     their  way,

verse      To      the   throne  of     God -  head,  To     the    Fa  -  ther's breast;
verse      He      is    God     the    Sav -  ior,   He     is     Christ the    Lord,
verse      Crown   Him   as      your   Cap -  tain   In     temp - ta  -  tion's hour:
verse      For     all   wreaths of     em  -  pire   Meet   up  -  on     His    brow,

verse      Who     from the      be -  gin - ning    Was     the   might - y    Word.
verse      Love,   in   love     e  -  ter - nal,    Rest,   in    per  -  fect rest.
verse      All     the  heav'n - ly    or -  ders    In      their great   ar - ray.
verse      Brought it   back     vic - to -  rious,  When    from  death   He   passed.
verse      Filled  it   with     the   glo - ry      Of      that  per  -  fect rest.
verse      Ev   -  er   to       be    wor - shiped, Trust - ed,   and     a -  dored.
verse      Let     His  will     en -  fold  you     In      its   light   and  pow'r.
verse      And     our  hearts   con - fess  Him     King    of    glo  -  ry   now.
