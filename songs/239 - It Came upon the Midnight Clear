verse      It    came    up - on    the    mid  -  night  clear, That  glo  -  rious song   of   old,
verse      Still through the  clo - ven    skies   they   come   With  peace - ful   wings  un - furled,
verse      And   ye,     be - neath life's crush - ing    load,  Whose forms   are   bend - ing  low,
verse      For   lo!     the  days  are    has  -  t'ning on,    By    proph - et -  bards  of   old,

verse      From an -  gels  bend  -  ing  near    the   earth  To    touch  their harps of     gold:
verse      And  still their heav'n - ly   mu   -  sic   floats O'er  all    the   wea - ry     world;
verse      Who  toil  a  -  long     the  climb - ing   way    With  pain - ful   steps and    slow,
verse      When with  the   ev   -   er - cir  -  cling years  Shall come   the   time  fore - told

verse      Peace on    the   earth, good will   to  men,    From heav'n's all - gra  -  cious King.
verse      A  -  bove  its   sad    and  low -  ly  plains, They bend     on    hov  -  'ring wing,
verse      Look  now!  for   glad   and  gold - en  hours   Come swift -  ly    on      the   wing.
verse      When  peace shall o   -  ver  all    the earth   Its  an   -   cient splen - dors  fling,

verse      The world in    sol  - emn  still - ness lay,   To    hear    the an - gels sing.
verse      And ev -  er    o'er   its  Ba   -  bel  sounds The   bless - ed  an - gels sing.
verse      O   rest  be -  side   the  wea  -  ry   road,  And   hear    the an - gels sing!
