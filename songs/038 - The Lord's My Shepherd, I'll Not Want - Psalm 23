verse      will   I    fear  none ill,  For    Thou  art   with   me,
verse      pres - ence of    my   foes; My     head  Thou  dost   with
verse      sure - ly   fol - low  me;   And    in    God's house  for -

verse      and     Thy    rod    And  staff   me  com - fort   still.

verse      ev   -  er  -  more   My   dwell - ing place shall  be.
