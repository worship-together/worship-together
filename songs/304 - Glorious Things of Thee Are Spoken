verse      Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God;

verse      He whose word cannot be broken Formed thee for his own abode;

verse      On the Rock of Ages founded, What can shake thy sure repose?

verse      With salvation's walls surrounded, Thou may'st smile at all thy foes.

verse      See the streams of living waters, Springing from eternal love,

verse      Well supply thy sons and daughters, And all fear of want remove;

verse      Who can faint while such a river Ever flows their thirst t'assuage?

verse      Grace, which like the Lord, the giver, Never fails from age to age.

verse      Round each habitation hov'ring, See the cloud and fire appear

verse      For a glory and a cov'ring, Showing that the Lord is near;

verse      Thus deriving from their banner

verse      Light by night and shade by day,

verse      Safe they feed upon the manna Which he gives them when they pray.

verse      Savior, if of Zion's city I, thro' grace, a member am,

verse      Let the world deride or pity, I will glory in thy name;

verse      Fading is the worldling's pleasure, All his boasted pomp and show;

verse      Solid joys and lasting treasure None but Zion's children know.
