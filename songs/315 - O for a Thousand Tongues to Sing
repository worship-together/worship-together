verse      O    for     a     thou - sand   tongues to     sing   My   great  Re - deem -  er's  praise,
verse      My   gra  -  cious Mas -  ter    and     my     God,   As - sist   me   to      pro - claim,
verse      Je - sus!    the   name   that   charms  our    fears, That bids   our  sor -   rows  cease,
verse      He   breaks  the   power  of     can  -  celled sin,   He   sets   the  pris  - oner  free;
verse      He   speaks, and,  lis -  t'ning to      His    voice, New  life   the  dead    re -  ceive,
verse      Hear Him,    ye    deaf;  His    praise, ye     dumb,  Your loos - ened tongues em -  ploy;

verse      The  glo  -  ries    of    my   God    and   King,  The  tri - umphs of     His  grace!
verse      To   spread  through all   the  earth  a  -  broad  The  hon - ors   of     Thy  name.
verse      'Tis mu  -   sic     in    the  sin -  ner's ears,  'Tis life  and   health and  peace.
verse      His  blood   can     make  the  foul - est   clean; His  blood a  -  vailed for  me.
verse      The  mourn - ful,    bor - ken  hearts re -  joice, The  hum - ble   poor   be - lieve.
verse      Ye   blind,  be   -  hold  your Sav -  ior   come,  And  leap, ye    lame,  for  joy.
