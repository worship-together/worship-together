verse      Come, ye    that love  the  Lord,  And   let    your joys be   known;
verse      Let   those re - fuse  to   sing   That  nev -  er   knew our  God;
verse      The   men   of   grace have found  Glo - ry     be - gun  be - low;
verse      The   hill  of   Zi  - on   yields A     thou - sand sa - cred sweets
verse      Then  let   our  songs a -  bound, And   ev -   'ry  tear be   dry;

verse      Join  in      a    song    with sweet    ac -  cord,  And  thus   sur - round  the throne.
verse      But   chil  - dren of      the  heav'n - ly    King   May  speak  their joys   a - broad.
verse      Ce -  les  -  tial fruits  on   earth  - ly    ground From faith  and   hope   may grow.
verse      Be -  fore    we   reach   the  heav'n - ly    fields Or   walk   the   gold - en  streets.
verse      We're march - ing  through Im - man   -  uel's ground To   fair - er    worlds on  high.
