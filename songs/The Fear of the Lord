verse      The fear of the Lord Is    clean and ap -  prov'd, Makes Sa  -  tan   ab - hor'd  And Je    -    sus    be - lov'd.
verse      The fear of the Lord Is    low - ly  and   meek;   The   hap -  py    re - ward   Of  all        that   Him  seek.
verse      The fear of the Lord His   mer - cy  makes dear,   His   judg - ments a -  dor'd, His right   -  eous - ness clear.
verse      The fear of the Lord Con - firms a   good  hope:   By    this   are   re - stor'd The sens   -   es     that droop.
verse      The fear of the Lord For - bids  us  to    yield.  It    shar -  pens our  sword; It  strength - ens    our  shield:

verse      It     con -  quers by    weak -  ness, Is   proof  a  -  gainst  strife;   A    cor - dial   in sick -  ness; A   foun - tain of   life.
verse      They   on  -  ly    that  fear    Him   The  truth  can   dis  -  cern,     For  liv - ing    so near    Him   His sec -  rets they learn.
verse      With - out    its   fresh fla  -  vor   In   know - ledge there's fault,    In   doc - trines no fav  -  or,   In  du  -  ties no   salt.
verse      The    deep - er    it    reach - es,   The  more   the   soul    thrives.  It   gives what   it teach - es    And guards what it   gives.
verse      Then   cry    we    to    Heav -  en    With one    loud  ac   -  cord      That to    us     be giv  -  en    The fear   of   the  Lord.
