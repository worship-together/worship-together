verse      O   lit -  tle    town  of  Beth - le  -  hem, How  still  we    see  thee lie;
verse      For Christ is     born  of  Mar_    -     y,   And  gath - ered  all  a -  bove,
verse      How si  -  lent - ly,   how si  -  lent - ly,  The  won -  drous gift is   giv'n!
verse      O   ho  -  ly     child of  Beth - le  -  hem, De - scend  to    us,  we   pray;

verse      A  -  bove  thy  deep   and dream - less sleep  The   si   -  lent stars go     by:
verse      While mor - tals sleep, the an   -  gels keep   Their watch   of   won - d'ring love.
verse      So    God   im - parts  to  hu   -  man  hearts The   bless - ings of    His    heav'n.
verse      Cast  out   our  sin    and en   -  ter  in;    Be    born    in   us    to  -  day.

verse      Yet in     thy dark     streets shin - eth  The   ev -  er - last - ing   Light;
verse      O   morn - ing stars,   to   -  geth - er   Pro - claim the  ho  -  ly    birth!
verse      No  ear    may hear     His     com -  ing, But   in    this world  of    sin,
verse      We  hear   the Christ - mas     an  -  gels The   great glad ti  -  dings tell;

verse      The   hopes   and   fears of   all   the  years  Are met   in     thee  to - night.
verse      And   prais - es    sing  to   God   the  King,  And peace to     men   on   earth.
verse      Where meek    souls will  re - ceive Him  still, The dear  Christ en -  ters in.
verse      O     come    to    us,   a -  bide  with us,    Our Lord  Em  -  man - u -  el!
