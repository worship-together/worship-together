verse      Out of the depths I have cried to You, O Lord; Lord, hear my voice!

verse      Let Your ears be at - ten - tive To the voice of my sup - pli - ca - tions.

verse      If You, Lord, should mark in - iq - ui - ties, O Lord, who could stand?

verse      But there is for - give - ness with You, That You may be feared.

verse      I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, And in His word I do hope.

verse      My soul waits for the Lord More than those who watch for the morn - ing--

verse      And with Him is a - bun - dant re - demp - tion.

verse      And He shall re - deem Is - ra - el From all his in - iq - ui - ties.
