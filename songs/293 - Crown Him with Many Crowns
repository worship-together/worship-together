verse      Crown Him with man - y crowns, The   Lamb  up  -  on     His throne; Hark!
verse      Crown Him the  Lord of life!   Who   tri - umphed o'er   the grave,  Who
verse      Crown Him the  Lord of love!   Be -  hold  His    hands  and side,   Rich
verse      Crown Him the  Lord of Peace,  Whose pow'r  a     scep - ter sways   From
verse      Crown Him the  Lord of years,  The   Po -  ten  - tate   of  time,   Cre -

verse      How     the   heav'n - ly   an -  them   drowns   All  mu  - sic   but  its    own!     A -
verse      rose    vic - tor  -  ious  in     the   strife   For  those  He   came  to    save.    His
verse      wounds, yet   vis  -   i -  ble     a -  bove,    In   beau - ty   glo - ri -  fied.    No
verse      pole    to    pole,   that  wars   may   cease,   Ab - sorbed in  prayer and   praise.  His
verse      a   -   tor   of      the   roll - ing   spheres, In - ef  -  fa - bly   sub - lime.    All

verse      wake,  my   soul   and sing   Of  Him   Who  died   for   thee,  And
verse      glor - ies  now    we  sing,  Who died, and  rose    on   high,  Who
verse      an  -  gel  in     the sky    Can ful - ly   bear   that  sight, But
verse      reign shall know   no  end,   And round His  pierc - ed   feet   Fair
verse      hail,  Re - deem - er, hail!  For Thou  hast died    for  me;    Thy

verse      hail   Him  as    thy match - less  King   Through   all    e -  ter - ni - ty.
verse      down - ward bends His burn -  ing   eye    At        mys - ter - ies   so   bright.
verse      died    e -  ter - nal life    to   bring, And      lives  that  death may  die.
verse      flow'rs of  Par - a - dise     ex - tend   Their    fra - grance  ev - er   sweet.
verse      praise and  glo - ry  shall   not   fail   Through - out    e -  ter - ni - ty.
