verse      Through  ev - 'ry   age,    e -  ter -  nal   God,
verse      Long    hadst thou reigned ere   time    be - gan,
verse      But      man, weak  man,   is    born    to   die,
verse      Death,  like   an    o  -  ver - flow - ing  stream,
verse      Teach    us,   O    Lord,  how  frail    is   man;

verse      Thou  art   our  rest,   our safe   a - bode;
verse      Or    dust  was  fash - ioned in - to   man;
verse      Made   up    of  guilt   and  van - i - ty;
verse      Sweeps us     a - way;   our life's a   dream-
verse      And   kind - ly  length - en  out  the  span,

verse      High    was    thy throne ere heav'n   was  made,
verse      And    long    Thy king - dom  shall   en - dure,
verse      Thy    dread - ful sen - tence, Lord,  was  just--
verse      An      emp -  ty  tale--  a    morn - ing  flow'r,
verse      Till, cleansed by  grace,  we   all    may  be

verse      Or    earth thy hum -  ble  foot - stool laid.
verse      When  earth and time   shall be     no   more.
verse      Re -  turn, ye  sin -  ners, to    your  dust.
verse      Cut   down  and with - er'd  in     an   hour.
verse      Pre - pared to  die,   and  dwell  with  thee.

verse      High    was    thy throne ere heav'n   was  made,
verse      And    long    Thy king - dom  shall   en - dure,
verse      Thy    dread - ful sen - tence, Lord,  was  just--
