verse      Je - sus,  the ver - y     thought of     Thee   With sweet - ness fills my   breast;
verse      Nor  voice can sing, nor   heart   can    frame, Nor  can     the  mem - 'ry  find,
verse      O    Hope  of  ev -  'ry   con  -  trite  heart, O    Joy     of   all   the  meek,
verse      But  what  to  those who   find?   Ah,    this   Nor  tongue  nor  pen   can  show;
verse      Je - sus,  our on -  ly    joy     be     Thou,  As   Thou    our  prize wilt be;

verse      But  sweet - er  far   Thy  face  to    see,  And  in      Thy pres - ence  rest.
verse      A    sweet - er  sound than Thy   blest name, O    Sav  -  ior of     man - kind.
verse      To   those   who fall, how  kind  Thou  art!  How  good    to  those  who   seek!
verse      The  love    of  Je -  sus, what  it    is,   None but     His loved  ones  know.
verse      Je - sus,    be  Thou  our  glo - ry    now,  And  through e - ter -  ni -  ty.
