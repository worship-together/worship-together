verse       At      the  Lamb's high  feast we   sing    Praise  to   our  vic - tor   -  ious King,
verse       Where   the  Pas -  chal  blood is   poured, Death's dark an - gel   sheathes his  sword;
verse       Might - y    vic -  tim   from  the  sky,    Pow'rs  of   hell be -  neath    Thee lie;
verse       Pas  -  chal tri -  umph, Pas - chal joy,    On   -  ly   sin  can   this     de - stroy;

verse       Who   hath    washed us     in   the   tide   Flow -  ing  from    His  pierc - ed  side;
verse       Is -  rael's  hosts  tri -  um - phant go     Through the  wave    that drowns  the foe.
verse       Death is      con -  quered in   the   fight, Thou    hast brought us   life    and light:
verse       From  sin's   power  do     Thou set   free   Souls   re - born,   O    Lord,   in  Thee.

verse       Praise we  Him     whose love  di - vine    Gives His     sa -  cred blood for  wine,
verse       Praise we  Christ, Whose blood was  shed,   Pas - chal    vic - tim, pas - chal bread;
verse       Now    Thy ban  -  ner   Thou  dost wave;   Van - quished Sa -  tan  and   the  grave:
verse       Hymns  of  glo  -  ry,   songs of   praise, Fa -  ther,   un -  to   Thee  we   raise;

verse       Gives His   bod - y   for    the feast, Christ the    vic -  tim, Christ the priest.
verse       With  sin - cer - i - ty     and love   Eat    we     man -  na   from   a - bove.
verse       An -  gels  join  His praise to  tell,  See    o'er - thrown the  prince of  hell.
verse       Ris - en    Lord, all praise to  Thee,  Ev  -  er     with   the  Spir - it  be.
