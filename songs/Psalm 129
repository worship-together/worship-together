verse      Man - y a time they have af - flic - ted me from my youth, Let Is - ra - el now say--

verse      Many a time they have af - flic - ted me from my youth; Yet they have not pre - vailed a - gainst me.

verse      The plow - ers plowed on my back; They made their fur - rows long.

verse      The Lord is right - eous; He has cut in piec - es the cords of the wick - ed.

verse      Let all those who hate Zi - on Be put to shame and turned back.

verse      Let them be as the grass on the house - tops, Which with - ers be - fore it grows up,

verse      With which the reap - er does not fill his hand,

verse      Nor he who binds sheaves, his arms. Neith - er let those who pass by them say,

verse      The bless - ing of the Lord be up - on you; We bless you in the name of the Lord!
