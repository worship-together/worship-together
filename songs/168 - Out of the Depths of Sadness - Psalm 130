verse      Out  of     the depths of    sad - ness,  O    LORD,     I    cried   to   Thee;
verse      If,  show - ing no     com - pas - sion,  Thou should'st our  sins    re - cord
verse      I    wait   for God    to    hide  me;    My   soul,     with long -  ing  stirred,
verse      Hope in     the LORD,  O     na -  tion!  With Him       is   stead - fast love;

verse      Thou  Who    canst  fill with    glad - ness,  Lend  now  Thy   ear    to  me.
verse      And   mark   all    our  trans - gres - sions, Who   then could stand, O   Lord?
verse      Shall hope,  what - e'er be   -  tide   me,    In    His  un -  fail - ing word.
verse      His   plen - te  -  ous  sal  -  va  -  tion   He'll send you   from   a - bove.

verse      O   Fount of    con - so - la   -  tion, At - tend  un - to    my   cry;
verse      But Thou  dost  par - don  ful  -  ly    All  our   in - iq -  ui - ty,
verse      For Thee, LORD, I     a    yearn - ing   With more  in - tense de - sire
verse      He  will  re -  deem  His  peo  -  ple,  His  cho - sen  Is -  ra - el,

verse      Hear Thou    my    sup - pli - ca  -  tion And  to   my  help   draw nigh.
verse      That we      may   serve Thee  tru -  ly   And  fear Thy maj -  es - ty.
verse      Than watch - ers   for   the   morn - ing  To   dawn of  day    as - spire.
verse      From all     their sin   and   e   -  vil, That they His praise may  tell.
