verse      The heav - ens de - clare the glo - ry of God; And the firm - a - ment shows His hand - i - work.

verse      Day un - to day ut - ters speech, And night un - to night re - veals know - ledge.

verse      There is no speech nor lan - guage Where their voice is not heard.

verse      Their line has gone out through all the earth, And their words to the end of the world.

verse      In them He has set a ta - ber - na - cle for the sun,

verse      Which is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamb - er, And rejoices like a strong man to run its race.

verse      Its ris - ing is from one end of heav'n, And its cir - cuit to the oth - er end;

verse      And there is noth - ing hid - den from its heat.

verse      The law of the Lord is perfect, con - vert - ing the soul;

verse      The testimony of the Lord is sure, mak - ing wise the simple;

verse      The statutes of the Lord are right, re - joic - ing the heart;

verse      The commandment of the Lord is pure, en - light - en - ing the eyes;

verse      The fear of the Lord is clean, en - dur - ing forever;

verse      The judgments of the Lord are true and right - eous al - to - gether.

verse      More to be de - sired are they than gold, Yea, than much fine gold;

verse      Sweet - er al - so than hon - ey and the hon - ey - comb.

verse      More - o - ver by them Your ser - vant is warned,

verse      And in keep - ing them there is great reward.

verse      Who can under - stand his errors?

verse      Cleanse me from sec - ret faults.

verse      Keep back Your servant also from pre - sump - tuous sins;

verse      Let them not have do - min - ion o - ver me.

verse      Then I shall be blame - less,

verse      And I shall be inno - cent of great trans - gression.

verse      Let the words of my mouth and the med - i - ta - tion of my heart

verse      Be ac - cept - a - ble in Your sight, O Lord, my strength and my Re - deem - er.
