verse      Make a joy - ful shout to the Lord, all you lands!

verse      Serve the Lord with glad - ness; Come be - fore His pres - ence with sing - ing.

verse      Know that the Lord, He is God; It is He who has made us, and not we our - selves;

verse      For the Lord is good; His mer - cy is ev - er - last - ing,

verse      And His truth en - dures to all gen - er - a - tions.
