verse      O     wor -  ship  the  King   all - glo -  rious a -  bove,  O
verse      O     tell   of    His  might  and   sing   of    His  grace, Whose
verse      Thy   boun - ti -  ful  care,  what  tongue can   re - cite?  It
verse      Frail chil - dren  of   dust,  and   fee -  ble   as   frail, In
verse      O     meas - ure - less Might, In -  ef  -  fa -  ble  Love,  Whom

verse      grate -  ful - ly   sing   His   power  and  His love:   Our
verse      robe     is    the  light, whose can -  o -  py  space.  His
verse      breathes in    the  air,   it    shines in   the light;  It
verse      You      do    we   trust, nor   find   You  to  fail.   Your
verse      an   -   gels  de - light  to    wor -  ship a - bove!   Your

verse      Shield  and   De -  fend - er,   the  An  -  cient of     Days,  Pa -
verse      char -  iots  of    wrath  the   deep thun - der - clouds form,  And
verse      streams from  the   hills, it    de - scends to    the    plain, And
verse      mer  -  cies, how   ten -  der,  how  firm   to    the    end,   Our
verse      ran  -  somed cre - a   -  tion, with glo -  ry    a   -  blaze, In

verse      vil  -  ioned in    splen - dor  and   gird - ed   with praise.
verse      dark    is    His   path    on   the   wings  of   the  storm.
verse      sweet - ly    dis - tills   in   the   dew    and  the  rain.
verse      Mak  -  er,   De -  fend -  er,  Re -  deem - er,  and  Friend!
