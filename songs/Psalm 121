verse      I will lift up my eyes to the hills-- From whence comes my help?

verse      My help comes from the Lord, Who made heav - en and earth.

verse      He will not al - low your foot to be moved; He who keeps you will not slum - ber.

verse      Be - hold, He who keeps Is - ra - el shall nei - ther slum - ber nor sleep.

verse      The Lord is your keep - er; The Lord is your shade at your right hand.

verse      The sun shall not strike you by day, Nor the moon by night.

verse      The Lord shall pre - serve you from all e - vil; He shall pre - serve your soul.

verse      The Lord shall pre - serve your go - ing out and your com - ing in

verse      From this time forth, and e - ven for - ev - er - more.
