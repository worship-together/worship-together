verse      As  with  glad - ness   men   of   old   Did  the  guid - ing  star  be - hold;
verse      As  with  joy -   ful  steps they  sped   To  that  low - ly   cra - dle - bed,
verse      As  they   of -  fered gifts most  rare   At  that  cra - dle  rude  and  bare;
verse      Ho - ly    Je  - sus,   ev -  'ry  day   Keep  us   in    the  nar - row   way;
verse      In  the  heav'n - ly   coun - try bright Need they  no    cre - at - ed   light;

verse      As   with  joy   they hailed its light, Lead - ing   on  -  ward, beam - ing bright;
verse      There to  bend   the   knee  be - fore  Him   whom heav'n   and  earth    a - dore;
verse      So   may   we    with   ho - ly   joy,  Pure,  and  free    from sin's   al - loy,
verse      And  when earth - ly  things are  past, Bring  our   ran - somed souls   at   last
verse      Thou its  light, its   joy,  its crown, Thou   its   sun   which  goes   not  down;

verse      So,   most gra  - cious  God,   may   we      Ev -  er - more  be   led     to  thee.
verse      So    may   we     with  wil -  ling feet     Ev -  er   seek  thy  mer  -  cy  seat.
verse      All   our  cost - liest treas - ures bring, Christ, to   thee, our heav'n - ly  King.
verse      Where they need    no   star     to  guide, Where   no  clouds thy  glo  -  ry  hide.
verse      There for - ev  -  er    may     we  sing     Al -  le -  lu - ias   to     our King.
