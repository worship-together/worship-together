verse      	My   hope   is    built on   noth - ing less   Than  Je - sus' blood and  right - eous - ness;
verse       When dark - ness  veils His  love - ly  face,  I     rest on   His   un - chang - ing    grace;
verse       His  oath,  His   cov - e -  nant,  His blood, Sup - port me   in    the  whelm - ing    flood;
verse       When He     shall come  with trum - pet sound, Oh,   may  I    then  in   Him     be     found;

verse       I       dare not trust   the    sweet - est   frame, But     whol - ly   lean  on     Je - sus' name.
verse       In      ev - ery high    and    stor -  my    gale,  My      an  -  chor holds with - in   the  veil.
verse       When    all  a - round   my     soul    gives way,   He      then   is   all   my     hope and  stay.
verse       Dressed in   His right - eous - ness,   a  -  lone,  Fault - less   to   stand be  -  fore the  throne.
