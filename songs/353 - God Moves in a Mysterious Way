verse      God   moves  in    a       mys - te  -  rious way    His
verse      Deep  in     un -  fath -  om -  a   -  ble   mines  Of
verse      Ye    fear - ful   saints, fresh cour - age   take;  The
verse      Judge not    the   Lord    by    fee  - ble   sense, But
verse      His   pur -  pos - es      will  rip  - en    fast,  Un -
verse      Blind un  -  be -  lief    is    sure   to    err,   And

verse      won -  ders to     per - form;  He   plants  His  foot -  steps
verse      nev -  er - fail - ing   skill  He   treas - ures up      His
verse      clouds ye   so     much  dread  Are  big     with mer  -  cy,
verse      trust  Him  for    His   grace; Be - hind    a    frown - ing
verse      fold - ing  ev  -  'ry   hour;  The  bud     may  have    a
verse      scan   His  work   in    vain;  God  is      His  own     in -

verse      in     the   sea,   And rides   up - on     the    storm.
verse      bright de -  signs, And works   His  sov -  ereign will.
verse      and    shall break  In  bless - ings on     your   head.
verse      prov - i  -  dence  He  hides   a    smil - ing    face.
verse      bit -  ter   taste, But sweet   will be     the    flower.
verse      ter -  pre - ter,   and He      will make   it     plain.
