verse      Mo - ses  ro     Him   prayed, Aar  -  on    sought His   aid;
verse      He   to   Is  -  rael  spoke   in      a     cloud  of    smoke;
verse      When they called on    Thee,   Thou    didst hear   their plea;

verse      Let   the   peo - ple's  quake,  earth's foun -  da  -  tions shake,
verse      Ho -  ly    is    the    LORD    and     to      be     a  -  dored.

verse      They  His   glo - ry     saw,    wor  -  shipped Him    with  awe.
verse      Thou  didst par - don    them,   though  a   -   veng - ing   sin.

verse      For  in    Zi  -  on    He     shows  His   maj - es  -  ty
verse      Let  them  praise their King,  of     His   jus - tice   sing.
verse      At   His   foot - stool bow    and    re -  vere  Him    now.
verse      They cried out    to    Him    and    He    an -  swered them;
verse      He,  the   LORD,  their Guide, stat - utes  did   pro -  vide
verse      Come to    Zi  -  on's  hill   and    per - form  God's  will;
