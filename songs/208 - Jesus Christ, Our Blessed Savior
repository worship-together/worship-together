verse      Je  -  sus   Christ, our   bless - ed    Sav -  ior,
verse      As     His   pledge  of    love    un -  dy  -  ing,
verse      Who -  so    to      this  Board   re -  pair - ing
verse      Praise the   Fa  -   ther, who     from  heav - en
verse      Thou   shalt hold    with  faith   un -  shak - en
verse      Christ says: Come,   all   ye      that  la  -  bor,
verse      Use -  less  were    for   thee    My    Pas -  sion,
verse      If     thy   heart   this  truth   pro - fess - es

verse      Turned a - way   God's wrath for - ev  -  er;
verse      He,   this pre - cious food  sup - ply -  ing,
verse      May   take heed  how   He    pre - par -  eth;
verse      To    His  own   this  food  hath  giv -  en,
verse      That  this food  is    to    be    tak -  en
verse      And   re - ceive My    grace and   fa  -  vor:
verse      If    thy  works thy   weal  could fash - ion.
verse      And   your mouth your  sin   con - fess - es,

verse      By    His   bit - ter  grief  and   woe
verse      Gives His   bod - y    with   the   bread,
verse      For   if    he    does not    be -  lieve,
verse      Who,  to    mend  what we     have  done,
verse      By    the   sick  who  are    dis - tressed,
verse      They  who   feel  no   want   nor   ill
verse      This  feast is    not  spread for   thee
verse      His   dear  guest thou here   shalt be,

verse      He   saved   us    from  the    e  -  vil  Foe.
verse      And  with    the   wine  the    blood He   shed.
verse      Then death   for   life  he     shall re - ceive.
verse      Gave in   -  to    death His    on -  ly   Son.
verse      By   hearts  that  long  for    peace and  rest.
verse      Need no      phy - si -  cian's help  nor  skill.
verse      If   thine   own   Sav - ior    thou  wilt be.
verse      And  Christ  Him - self  shall  ban - quet thee.
