verse      I     wait - ed   for   the   LORD; He  stooped and  heard my   cry.
verse      Man - y      will see   with  awe,  And so      will trust the  LORD.
verse      You   want   no   of -  fer - ing,  Nor ask     a    sac - ri - fice,
verse      To    do     Your will, O     God,  To  me      is   my    de - light.

verse      He      brought me   from   the pit, Out  of     the dun -  geon  mire,
verse      Blessed he      who  trusts in  God, And  turns  not to     false men.
verse      But     You     have giv -  en  me   A    read - y   ear    to    hear.
verse      Your    law     is   part   of  me,  Deep in     my  heart, O     God.

verse      My  feet  set    on    a       rock, My  foot - steps made    se  -  cure.
verse      You have  worked won - ders,   LORD; No  one    com - pares   to     You!
verse      You ask   no     of -  f'rings burnt Nor sac -  ri -  fice    for    sin.
verse      In  con - gre -  ga -  tion    great I   told   Your  right - eous - ness.

verse      My     lips  He    gave  a     song, A     song  to  praise our  God.
verse      Should I     de -  clare each  one,  Their num - ber is     too  great.
verse      So     I     say,  Here  I     come, As    in    the scroll in - scribed.
verse      You    know, LORD, I     spoke out;  I     did   not close  my   lips.
