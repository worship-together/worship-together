verse      The day    of  re   -  sur - rec - tion!  Earth, tell  it  out  a -  broad;
verse      Our hearts be  pure    from  e  -  vil,   That   we    may see  a -  right
verse      Now let    the heav'ns be    joy - ful,   Let    earth her song be - gin,

verse      The Pass - o  -  ver  of   glad - ness, The Pass - o  -  ver   of      God.
verse      The Lord   in    rays e   -  ter - nal  Of  re  -  sur - rec - tion    light;
verse      The round  world keep high tri -  umph, And all    that  is    there - in;

verse      From death  to     life e - ter - nal,   From  earth un - to   the  sky,
verse      And, list - 'ning  to   his ac -  cents, May   hear  so   calm and  plain
verse      Let  all    things seen and un -  seen   Their notes to - ge - ther blend,

verse      Our Christ hath brought us   o   -  ver  With hymns of   vic - to - ry.
verse      His own    All  hail!   and, hear - ing, May  raise the  vic - tor  strain.
verse      For Christ the  Lord    is   ris -  en,  Our  joy   that hath  no   end.
