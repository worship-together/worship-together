verse      Our   tri - une   God    rules o  -  ver all,   And  feeds all  crea - tures great  and  small.
verse      His   Word  re -  stores the   blind to  sight; Our  God   has  made   the   dark - ness light.
verse      At    this  white ta  -  ble,  wine  and bread  Will weave us   now    in -  to     the  Head,
verse      The   Lord  has   spo -  ken   liv - ing words, He   gave  us   ears,  and   thus   we   heard.
verse      Sal - va -  tion  comes  and,  face  to  face,  He   sets  be - fore   us    means  of   grace.
