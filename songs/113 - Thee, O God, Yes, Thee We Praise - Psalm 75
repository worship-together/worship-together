verse      Thee,  O        God,    yes, Thee   we  praise, And  we   give
verse      When   the'ap - point - ed   time   is  there,  I    My   judg -
verse      To     the      proud   and  bold   I   say,    Let  Me   no
verse      Help - ers      will    not  from   the east    And  not  from
verse      For    the      LORD    has  filled a   bowl    With wine foam -
verse      Psalms I        sing    and  praise I   shout;  I    will pay

verse      Thee thanks, O    LORD,   For   the   proud  get their re -  ward
verse      ment will    re - veal.   Tot - ter   may    the earth and   reel,
verse      more hear    your boast.  I     tell  them   and all   their host
verse      the  west    ap - pear    To    ex -  alt    and to    re -  vere
verse      ing, spiced  and  strong; All   the   wick - ed  and   the   wrong,
verse      my   vows    to   God.    I     shall ev  -  er  heed  His   rod;

verse      And  the   wick - ed    Thou   shalt  raze,   But  we   laud   Thy
verse      When it    has    My    wrath  to     bear;   I    did  fash - ion
verse      To   for - sake   their wick - ed     way:    Do   not  lift   your
verse      Him  whom  God    makes last   and    least.  He,  the  Judge  of
verse      All  who   hound  His   ser -  vant's soul,   Shun this cup    of
verse      Ja - cob's God,   my    joy    rings  out:    All  the  wick - ed

verse      mer - cy's fount, And  Thy  won - ders      we   re -  count.
verse      it    of   old    And  its  pil - lars      I    up -  hold.
verse      horn  on   high,  Nor  with out - stretched neck draw  nigh.
verse      great re - nown,  Will lift up    and       will bring down.
verse      wrath in   vain;  E'en the  dregs they      have to    drain.
verse      feel  Thy  scorn, But  Thou shalt ex    -   alt  our   horn!
