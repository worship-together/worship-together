verse      Why do     the   heath - en  na   -  tions vain - ly rage?
verse      He  speaks to    them    in  right - eous, ho  -  ly wrath;
verse      The na  -  tions come;   You are     the   on  -  ly Heir,

verse      What pride - ful schemes are  they in   vain  de -  vis  -  ing?
verse      God  vex  -  es  them    and  show His  great dis - pleas - ure.
verse      The  ends    of  earth   will be   Your own   pos - es   -  sion

verse      The kings of  earth and rul - ers  all en - gage
verse      Yet have  I   set   My  King  up - on  the  path
verse      And bro - ken with  a   rod   of   i - ron  there,

verse      In   e  -  vil  plots, and   in   their sin con  - triv  - - - ing,
verse      That up -  ward winds  to    Zi - on,   My  own    treas - - - ure.
verse      Re - bel - ious pot -  ter - y    comes to  de  -  struc - - - tion.

verse      They take  their stand a -  gainst our God's  Mes - si  -  ah;
verse      You  are   My    Son,  to - day    You are    be -  got -  ten,
verse      Now  serve the   LORD, with fear   and glad - ness  trem - bling,

verse      They claim   they  will  not  keep   His  bind - ing chains.
verse      I    will    de -  clare what God    has  said   to  Me
verse      And  there - fore, O     ye   kings, seek wis -  dom here.

verse      The one     en - throned in   high - est    heav - en,   high - er,
verse      And not     one  tribe   will ev  -  er     be     for - got -  ten.
verse      How blessed are  those   who  trust  with - out    dis - sem -  bling,

verse      Mocks them to   scorn, on  them   de - ri -  sion  rains.
verse      You   will re - ceive  the world, just ask   of    Me.
verse      Who   kiss the  Son    and bow    in   rev - erent fear.
