verse      Be     Thou my vis -  ion, O   Lord  of    my   heart;
verse      Be     Thou my wis -  dom, and Thou  my    true word;
verse      Rich - es   I  heed   not, nor man's emp - ty   praise,
verse      High   King of heav - en,  my  vic - to -  ry   won,

verse      Nought be   all   else     to    me,    save   that   Thou art -
verse      I      ev - er    with     Thee  and    Thou   with   me,  Lord;
verse      Thou   mine in -  her   -  i  -  tance, now    and    al - ways:
verse      May    I    reach heav'n's joys, O      bright heav - en's Sun!

verse      Thou  my  best  thought_       by     day   or  by   night,
verse      Thou  my  great Fa_     -      ther,  I     Thy true son;
verse      Thou  and Thou  on_     -      ly,    first in  my   heart,
verse      Heart of  my    own     heart, what - ev -  er  be - fall,

verse      Wak - ing  or sleep - ing, Thy pres -  ence my   light.
verse      Thou  in   me dwell - ing, and I       with Thee one.
verse      High  King of heav -  en,  my  Treas - ure  Thou art.
verse      Still be   my vis  -  ion, O   Ru   -  ler  of   all.
