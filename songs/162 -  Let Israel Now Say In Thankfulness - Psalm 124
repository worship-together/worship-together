verse      Let   Is - ra -  el    now say    in thank -  ful - ness
verse      Yea,  when their wrath a - gainst us fierce - ly    rose,
verse      Blest be   the   LORD  who made   us not      their prey;

verse      That if    the LORD  had   not our  right  main - tained
verse      Then would the tide  o'er  us  have spread its    wave;
verse      As   from  the fow - ler's net a    bird   may    flee,

verse      And if    the   LORD   had   not   with us   re - mained,
verse      The rag - ing   stream would have  be - come our  grave;
verse      So  from  their bro -  ken   snare did  we   go   free.

verse      When cru -  el  men    a - gainst  us    rose    to  strive,
verse      The  surg - ing flood, in  proud - ly    swell - ing roll,
verse      Our  on  -  ly  help   is  in      God's ho   -  ly  Name;

verse      We'd sure - ly  have  been swal - lowed up       a - live.
verse      Most sure - ly  would have o   -  ver - whelmed  us  all.
verse      He   made   the earth and  all    the   heaven - ly  frame.
