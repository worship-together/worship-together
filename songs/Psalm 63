verse      O God, You are my God; Ear - ly will I seek You;

verse      My soul thirsts for You; My flesh longs for You In a dry and thirst - y land Where there is no wa - ter.

verse      So I have looked for You in the sanc - tu - a - ry, To see Your pow - er and Your glo - ry.

verse      Be - cause Your lov - ing - kind - ness is bet - ter than life, My lips shall praise You.

verse      Thus I will bless You while I live; I will lift up my hands in Your name.

verse      My soul shall be sat - is - fied as with mar - row and fat - ness, And my mouth shall praise You with joy - ful lips.

verse      When I re - mem - ber You on my bed, I med - i - tate on You in the night watch - es.

verse      Be - cause You have been my help, Therefore in the shad - ow of Your wings I will re - joice.

verse      My soul fol - lows close be - hind You; Your right hand up - holds me.

verse      But those who seek my life, to de - stroy it, Shall go in - to the low - er parts of the earth.

verse      They shall fall by the sword; They shall be a por - tion for jack - als.  But the king shall re - joice in God;

verse      Ev - 'ry - one who swears by Him shall glo - ry; But the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.
