verse      Com - fort, com -  fort  ye   my  peo - ple, Speak   ye peace, thus saith our   God;
verse      Yea,  her   sins   our   God will par - don, Blot - ting  out  each dark  mis - deed;
verse      For   the   her - ald's voice is  cry - ing   In     the  des - ert  far  and   near,
verse      Make  ye  straight what long was crook - ed, Make    the rough - er plac - es   plain;

verse      Com - fort those  who   sit   in  dark - ness,  Bowed be - neath their sor - row's load.
verse      All   that  well  de - served His  an  -  ger    He   no   more   will see    or   heed.
verse      Bid - ding   all  men    to   re - pen - tance, Since the  king - dom  now    is   here.
verse      Let   your hearts be    true  and  hum -  ble,   As   be - fits   His   ho -  ly   reign.

verse      Speak ye  to     Je - ru - sa - lem   Of  the   peace that waits for  them;
verse      She  hath suf - fered man - y a day,  Now her  griefs have passed a - way;
verse      O    that warn - ing  cry   o - bey!  Now pre - pare  for   God   a   way;
verse      For  the  glo -  ry   of   the Lord   Now o'er  earth  is   shed  a - broad;

verse      Tell her   that  her  sins    I  cov - er,  And  her  war - fare   now     is   o  -  ver.
verse      God  will change her   pin - ing sad - ness In - to   ev  -  er - spring - ing glad - ness.
verse      Let  the   val - leys rise    to meet  him, And  the hills   bow   down    to  greet  him.
verse      And  all  flesh  shall see   the to -  ken, That His word    is    nev  -  er   bro - ken.
