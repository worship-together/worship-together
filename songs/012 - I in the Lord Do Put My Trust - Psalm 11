verse      I       in    the    Lord   do     put     my    trust:   How
verse      For,    lo,   the    wick - ed     bend    their bow,     Their
verse      If      the   foun - da  -  tions  be      de -  stroyed, What
verse      His     eyes  do     see,   His    eye  -  lids  try      Men's
verse      Snares, fire  and    brim - stone, fur  -  ious  storms,  On
verse      Be   -  cause the    Lord   most   right - eous  doth     In

verse      is      it     then    that  ye      Say   to    my   soul,   Flee,
verse      shafts  on     string  they  fit,    That  those who  up  -   right
verse      hath    the    right - eous  done?   God   in    His  ho  -   ly
verse      sons.   The    just    He    proves: But   His   soul hates   the
verse      sin  -  ners   He      shall rain:   This, as    the  por  -  tion
verse      right - eous - ness    de -  light;  And   with  a    pleas - ant

verse      as     a     bird, Un - to     your moun - tain  high?
verse      are    in    heart They priv - i -  ly     may   hit.
verse      tem -  ple   is,   In   heav - en   is     His   throne:
verse      wick - ed    man,  And  Him    that vio -  lence loves.
verse      of     their cup,  Doth un  -  to   them   per - tain.
verse      coun - te -  nance Be - hold - eth  the    up -  right.
