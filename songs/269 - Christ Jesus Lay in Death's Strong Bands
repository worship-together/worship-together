verse      Christ Je - sus  lay     in   death's strong bands, For     our     of - fens - es    giv -  en;
verse      It     was  a    strange and  dread - ful    strife When    life    and  death  con - tend - ed;
verse      Here   the  true Pas  -  chal Lamb    we     see,   Whom    God     so   free - ly    gave   us;
verse      So     let  us   keep    the  fes  -  ti  -  val    Where - to      the  Lord   in -  vites  us;
verse      Then   let  us   feast   this joy  -  ful    day    On      Christ, the  bread  of    heav - en;

verse      But    now   at    God's right hand   He   stands And brings us   life  from heav - en;
verse      The    vic - to -  ry    re -  mained with life,  The reign  of   death was  end -  ed;
verse      He     died  on    the   ac -  curs - ed   tree,  So  strong His  love! to   save   us.
verse      Christ is    Him - self  the   Joy    of   all,   The Sun    that warms and  lights us.
verse      The    Word  of    grace hath  purged a -  way    The old    and  e  -  vil  leav - en.

verse      There - fore let     us   joy  -  ful  be    And   sing   to  God    right thank - ful - ly
verse      Ho   -  ly   Scrip - ture plain - ly   saith That  death  is  swal - lowed up      by    death,
verse      See,    His  blood   doth mark    our  door; Faith points to  it,    Death pass -  es    o'er,
verse      By      His  grace   He   doth    im - part  E  -  ter -  nal sun -  shine to      the   heart;
verse      Christ  a -  lone    our  souls   will feed, He    is     our meat   and   drink   in -  deed;

verse      Loud  songs of   hal - le -  lu -  jah. Hal - le - lu - jah!
verse      His   sting is   lost  for - ev -  er.  Hal - le - lu - jah!
verse      And   Sa -  tan  can - not   harm  us.  Hal - le - lu - jah!
verse      The   night of   sin   is    end - ed.  Hal - le - lu - jah!
verse      Faith lives up - on    no    oth - er.  Hal - le - lu - jah!
