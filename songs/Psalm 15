verse      Lord, who may abide in Your tab - er - na - cle?  Who may dwell in Your ho - ly hill?

verse      He who walks up - right - ly, And works right - eous - ness, And speaks the truth in his heart;

verse      He who does not back - bite with his tongue, Nor does e - vil to his neigh - bor,

verse      Nor does he take up a re - proach a - gainst his friend;

verse      In whose eyes a vile person is de - spised, But he ho - nors those who fear the Lord;

verse      He who swears to his own hurt and does not change;

verse      He who does not put out his mon - ey at u - su - ry, Nor does he take a bribe a - gainst the in - no - cent.

verse      He who does these things shall ne - ver be moved.
