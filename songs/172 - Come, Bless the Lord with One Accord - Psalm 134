verse      Lift  up    your hands, in   prayer draw nigh
verse      The   LORD  now  bless  you  from   a -  bove,

verse      You  faith - ful ser -  vants of      the  LORD,
verse      Un - to      His sanc - tu -  ar   -  y    high;
verse      From Zi   -  on  in     His   bound - less love;

verse      Who in    His house  do    stand by  night;
verse      O   bless the LORD,  kneel at    His feet,
verse      Our God,  who heav'n and   earth did frame,

verse      And   praise Him  there with all   your   might.
verse      And   wor -  ship Him   with rev - 'rence meet.
verse      Blest be     His  great and  ho -  ly     Name.
