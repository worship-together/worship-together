verse      From heav'n O     praise the   LORD;   Ye   heights, His   glo  -  ry   raise.
verse      Yea  let    them  glo -  rious make    Je - ho   -   vah's match - less name;
verse      From earth  O     praise the   LORD,   Ye   deeps    and   all     be - low;
verse      Let  all    the   peo -  ple   praise, And  kings    of    ev   -  'ry  land;
verse      Je - ho  -  vah's name   be    praised A -  bove     the   earth   and  sky.

verse      All  an -  gels, praise ac - cord;  Let  all     His   host  give  praise.
verse      For  when  the   word   He   spake  They in   -  to    be -  ing   came.
verse      Wild winds that  do     His  word,  Ye   clouds, fire, hail, and   snow;
verse      Let  all   their voic - es   raise  Who  judge   and   give  com - mand.
verse      For  He    His   saints has  raised And  set     their power on    high.

verse      Praise Him    on    high, Sun,  moon, and    star,
verse      And    from   that  place Where fixed they   be,
verse      Ye     moun - tains high, Ye    ce -  dars   tall,
verse      By     young  and   old,  By    maid  and    youth,
verse      Him    praise ac -  cord, O     Is -  rael's race,

verse      Sun,  moon, and    star,  Ye     heav'ns a -  far,    And    cloud - y    sky.
verse      Where fixed they   be,    By     His     de - cree    They   can  -  not  pass.
verse      Ye    ce -  dars   tall,  Beasts great   and  small,  And    birds   that fly.
verse      By    maid  and    youth, His    name    in   truth   Should be      ex - tolled.
verse      O     Is -  rael's race,  Near   to      His  grace.  Praise ye      the  LORD.
