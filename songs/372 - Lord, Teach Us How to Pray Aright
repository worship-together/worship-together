verse      Lord, teach  us  how    to  pray  a - right With   rev' - rence and   with  fear.
verse      God   of     all grace, we  come  to  Thee  With   bro -  ken   con - trite hearts;
verse      Pa -  tience to  watch, and wait, and weep, Though mer -  cy    lond  de -  lay;

verse      Though dust and   ash  -  es   in     Thy sight, We    may,  we   must   draw near.
verse      Give,  what thine eye     de - lights to  see,   Truth in    the  in  -  ward parts;
verse      Cour - age  our   faint - ing  souls  to  keep,  And   trust Thee though Thou slay.

verse      We    per -  ish if   we  cease from pray'r; Oh,  grant      us   pow'r to  pray.
verse      Faith in     the on - ly  sac - ri - fice    That can        for  sin   a - tone;
verse      Give  these, and then Thy will  be   done;   Thus strength - ened with  all might,

verse      And when    to  meet   thee we  pre - pare, Lord, meet    us  on     our way.
verse      To  cast    our hopes, to   fix our   eyes  On    Christ, on  Christ a - lone.
verse      We, through Thy Spir - it   and Thy   Son,  Shall pray,   and pray   a - right.
