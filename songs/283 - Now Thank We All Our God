verse      Now thank  we   all    our  God   With heart and hands and voic - es,
verse      O    may  this bount - eous God Through all  our  life be  near   us,
verse      All praise and thanks   to  God   The   Fa - ther now  be   giv - en,

verse      Who  won - drous things  has  done,   In  whom  His world  re - joic - es;
verse      With ev  -  er     joy - ful hearts  And bless - ed peace  to   cheer  us,
verse      The  Son    and    Him   who reigns, With Them   in high - est  heav - en

verse      Who from our moth - ers' arms Hath blessed  us   on  our    way
verse      And keep us   in    His grace, And  guide   us  when per - plexed,
verse      The  one  e - ter - nal  God, Whom  earth  and heav'n a  -  dore;

verse      With count - less gifts of love, And still is  ours  to - day.
verse      And  free     us  from all ills  In  this world in  the   next.
verse      For  thus     it   was, is now,  And shall be   ev - er - more.
