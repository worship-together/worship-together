verse      The    church - 's    one     foun - da -  tion  Is   Je - sus  Christ, her  Lord;
verse      E  -   lect     from  ev  -   'ry    na -  tion, Yet  one  o'er all     the  earth,
verse      Though with     a     scorn - ful    won - der   Men  see  her  sore    op - pressed,
verse      The    church   shall nev  -  er     per - ish!  Her  dear Lord to      de - fend,
verse      'Mid   toil     and   tri  -  bu  -  la -  tion, And  tu - mult of      her  war,
verse      Yet    she      on    earth   hath   un -  ion   With God  the  Three   in   One,

verse      She is      His   new   cre - a   -  tion By   wa -  ter   and    the   Word:
verse      Her char  - ter   of    sal - va  -  tion One  Lord, one   faith, one   birth;
verse      By  schis - ms    rent  a  -  sun -  der, By   her - e  -  sies   dis - tressed,
verse      To  guide,  sus - tain, and   cher - ish, Is   with  her   to     the   end;
verse      She waits   the   con - sum - ma  -  tion Of   peace for - ev  -  er -  more;
verse      And mys  -  tic   sweet com - mun -  ion  With those whose rest   is    won:

verse      From   heav'n He    came  and  sought  her   To    be     His  ho -  ly   bride;
verse      One    ho  -  ly    name  she  bless - es,   Par - takes  one  ho -  ly   food,
verse      Yet    saints their watch are  keep -  ing,  Their cry    goes up,   How  long?
verse      Though there  be    those that hate    her,  And   false  sons in    her  pale,
verse      Till   with   the   vi -  sion glo  -  rious Her   long - ing  eyes  are  blest,
verse      O      hap -  py    ones  and  ho  -   ly!   Lord, give   us   grace that we,

verse      With His    own   blood  He    bought  her,  And   for  her life   He    died.
verse      And  to     one   hope   she   press - es,   With  ev - 'ry grace  en -  dued.
verse      And  soon   the   night  of    weep -  ing   Shall be   the morn   of    song.
verse      A -  gainst both  foe    and   trai -  tor   She   ev - er  shall  pre - vail.
verse      And  the    great church vic - to  -   rious Shall be   the church at    rest.
verse      Like them,  the   meek   and   low  -  ly,   On    high may dwell  with  thee.
