verse      	The Son    of  God    goes  forth to  war,  A     king  - ly   crown  to  gain;
verse       The mar - tyr  first, whose ea -  gle eye   Could pierce  be - yond   the grave,
verse       A glo  - rious band,  the   cho - sen few   On    whom   the   Spir - it  came,
verse	    A no   -  ble  ar  -  my,   men   and boys, The   ma -  tron   and   the  maid,

verse       His blood-red ban - ner streams a - far: Who fol - lows in  His train?
verse       Who saw   his Mas - ter in      the sky, And called on  Him to  save:
verse       Twelve val - iant saints, their hope they knew, And mocked the cross and flame.
verse       A - round the Sav - ior's throne re - joice, In robes of light ar - rayed.

verse       Who  best can  drink  his cup of  woe,    Tri - um - phant ov -  er  pain,
verse       Like Him, with par -  don on  his tongue, In   midst of    mor - tal pain,
verse       They met the ty - rant's bran - dished steel, The li - on's gor - y mane
verse       They climbed the steep as - cent of heav'n, Through per - il, toil, and pain:

verse       Who  pa -   tient bears  his  cross be - low,  He  fol - lows in His   train.
verse       He   prayed for   them   that did   the wrong: Who fol - lows in His   train?
verse       They bowed  their necks, the  death to   feel: Who fol - lows in their train?
verse       O    God,   to    us     may  grace be  given  To  fol - low  in their train.
